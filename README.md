# Augmented_Reality_And_Image_Mosaics
 
Part 1:Augmented Reality with Planar Homographies >>
In this part, we will be implementing an AR application step by step using planar
homographies. we will first learn to find point correspondences between two images and use
these to estimate the homography between them. Using this homography we will then warp
images and finally implement our own AR application.

Part 2: Image Mosaics >>
In this part , we will implement an image stitcher that uses image warping
and homographies to automatically create an image mosaic. We will focus on the case where
we have two input images that should form the mosaic, where we warp one image into the plane
of the second image and display the combined views.
